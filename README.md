# Predicting---Non-Usage-of-Internet-Users

The 2009 Canadian Internet Use Survey dataset was taken from the Stats Canada website, 
and it is about the non-use of the internet by individual residents of Canada 15 years of age and over,
living in the provinces in the year of 2009. It consists of 24 columns and 23179 rows. 
This dataset is important because it measures barriers to Internet access and use, online services, 
and using various digital technologies. With this information, 
the government can adopt policies to improve the conditions of this deficiency and to plan steps to make the internet accessible to everyone.
